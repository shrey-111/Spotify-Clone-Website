# Spotify Clone

This is a clone of Spotify website created using HTML,CSS and Java Script. This website aims to replicate the basic functionality and design of the original Spotify website. This project was designed to showcase my skills in front-end web development.It is a responsive and user-friendly web application that allows users to play music.I used HTML and CSS to design and style the interface, and I implemented JavaScript to handle user input and interaction such as basic playback controls -play, pause, and next.I also gained experience working with version control tools such as Git and GitHub. Tech Stacks used in this project are :HTML CSS Java Script.
